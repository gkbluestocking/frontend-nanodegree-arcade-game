#Synopsis#

This is Eleni Palmos's submission to Udacity's FEND Project Three Requirement.



#Motivation#

This project has been a huge challenge for me.



#License#

Don't make me laugh! But, if you feel so inclined to borrow my code, I grant an MIT license.



#Directions#

See my page at http://gkbluestocking.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game and check out my pink princess. Use the arrow keys to start the game and to move her around. If you stumble on a ladybug, you have to start again.



#Note#

My first reviewer suggested that create a character superclass but I opted to focus on game functionality first.
