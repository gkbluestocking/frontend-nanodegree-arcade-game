#Synopsis#

This is Eleni Palmos's submission to Udacity's FEND Project Three Requirement.

#Code Example#

#Motivation#

This project has been a huge challenge for me.

#License#

Don't make me laugh! But, if you feel so inclined to borrow my code, I grant an MIT license.

#Note#

My first reviewer suggested that create a character superclass but I opted to focus on game functionality first.
